Description:

This is a introduction of the project 2 I’m going to make during the winter holiday.
In last semester, we wrote codes about “Adventure Game”.
I created a very interesting one, and I want to make another game as winter project.
This game is called <All the flowers withered after my flourishing>, adapted from a story I wrote a year ago. 
Twelve high school students from the same class find themselves wake in an unknown place, and were told that they’ve been chosen as competitors of the competition <withered flowers>. They are having the pre-round now, and they have to win in order to get to the further rounds (totally three and each has different rules). The games are all reasoning games,which test the users’ logical ability.

In these rounds, users will experience very exciting games like werewolf, killing game, and Tarot game (original rules).
The very interesting thing is, there are several characters, and the user can choose which perspective they want to experience after viewing their introductions. If the user doesn’t find all the hidden secrets in a certain round, the user can experience the round through another character’s perspective. 
Also, there are user statistics such us “cleverness”. Users will fail if certain statistics are too low to pass. Furthermore, users can increase other characters’ favor on them by choosing certain options; if the “favor” reaches or surpasses a certain threshold in the end, the user can have the good end with that character as the user’s lover.

For each character’s perspective, there are different ends. Winning the game doesn’t represent good, for someones, losing may be the good end for them. The user should explore and think, which is the best place for the character.
